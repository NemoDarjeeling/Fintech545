the transpose of a diagonal matrix is itself
cholesky and pca are both ways to get C = LL', L to be specific
if x and error are normally distributed, we can simulate Y independently if we know the characteristic of Y, for instance the covariance matrix of Y in advance; it doesn't matter whether xs have multicollinearity
