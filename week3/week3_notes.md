why we cannot guarantee the positve semi definite when we do pairwise?
as we are using different info for each covariance, if we use same it will be X*X^t, but for different, no

the larger the lamda, the less we think most recent variance matters; the larger the most recent variance, the larger the current variance; the weight is only determined by the lamda, not related to the any past variances

gamma(Yk) = |Yk-A|, A is the input non-positive semi definite matrix that you want to change into semi definite.
