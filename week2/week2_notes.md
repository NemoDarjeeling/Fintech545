spearman coefficient is more robust for outlier circumstances, the largest number in an array of 6 numbers being 10000 or 10000000 would always have a rank of 6, of which if you use pearson, outlier would be hazardous.



beta 0 is the mean of error term

error term would be vector during practice

we need MLE for non-normal distribution

n-k is degree of freedom, d in k is the additional parameters, such as standard deviation in normal distribution, scale and xx in T-distribution

error of t depend only on error of t-1, not depend on t-2; while y depend on y-1 and y-1 depend on y-2 and ultimately y depend on all y before that
